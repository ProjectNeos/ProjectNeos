# Project NeOS
This is a collection of repositries for the development of the Neo operating system. 

The Neo OS is a large project that aims to build a fully functional operating system from scratch built off it's own native 
programming language and styling script.

## Why the name Neo?
**Neo** in the Greek language means **new**. This operating system is intended to be a new operating system experimenting with new ideas
and functionality. 

The name **Neo** was also chosen because of Neo Anderson from the matrix movies, specifcally because the leader
of this project is also called Mr. Anderson
